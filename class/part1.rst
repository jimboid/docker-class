==================================
Get going with Docker from Scratch
==================================

We will start out this class by installing Docker if you haven't already.

For ubuntu users this is now as simple as::

% sudo apt install docker.io

and so we don't have to sudo to use docker::

% sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

For folks not wanting to use ubuntu then you will need to head over to the docker website and look how to install for your platform here_.
